## Overview

DL4AVR is a stub for a library allowing to run pre-trained deep learning models on low-capability AVR microcontrollers. In case of this project it is AT90USB1286 on LaFortuna board. So far, the only supported model is 3-layer MLP (which can be sigmoid/relu activated). As a demo, I implemented a classic "hello Wwrld" Computer Vision classifier, which recognizes handwritten characters. Because of the limited memory capabilities- input images must be in size 9x9.

For this project I pretrained a 2-layer MLP using Keras and tensorFlow using MNIST dataset (which was downsized to 9x9 using OpenCv); [Python part of this project can be found in deeplearning4avr-python repository](https://github.com/wkr1u18/deeplearning4avr-python) 

## How does it work?

Weights between layers (including bias) vectors from trained model are saved into txt file (where the floats are rounded up to 5 significant places - standard float takes 32-bits of memory on AVR and store up to 5 significant numbers). Then contents of this file must be copied to `layers.h` file (in a future python script could be extended to autogenerate C source).

The weights are stored as arrays in Flash memory and are accessed by using `avr/pgmspace.h`.

The core of the library is `linalg.c` which provides basic linear algebra functions. My matrix multiplication code takes one of the matrices from RAM, and the another one from Flash and produces a result in RAM memory. Also, this file contains code for adding bias unit, which is then multiplied with bias vector bit of next weight matrix.

The `main.c` file contains `predict()` function, which takes a pointer to 81 element array (consisting of 9x9 pixels) and returns an int with a predicted number. The core operation of the prediction is very simple, as it is just basic forward propagation code written using functions from `linalg.c`.

```c 
    Matrix* input = add_bias_unit(create_from_pointer(1,81,inputData));
    Matrix* afterFirstLayer = apply_function(multiply(input,first_layer_weights),relu);
    Matrix* beforeSecondLayer = add_bias_unit(afterFirstLayer);
    Matrix* afterSecondLayer = multiply(beforeSecondLayer, second_layer_weights);
    retVal = getMax(afterSecondLayer->numbers,10);

## Demo application
The demo aplication loads one number from memory, prints the pixels to screen and displays the prediction. The code for displaying uses Klaus-Peter Zauner's and Steve Gunn's library for LaFortuna board display.
